# Predicting NVIDIA stock performance based on key financial and technology indicators.
This project embarks on a journey to predict NVIDIA stock performance using cutting-edge machine learning techniques and by leveraging essential economic indicators. I will also consider the performance of key players in the tech industry, such as Intel and AMD, to gain a holistic view of the market dynamics. By analyzing historical data and identifying correlations between these variables, the goal is to provide valuable insights to investors, financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders.

# Required Libraries:
matplotlib: data visualization library for Python, widely used in data analysis, scientific research, engineering, and visualization tasks.

numpy: numerical computations and data manipulation in Python.

pandas: data manipulation, preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

seaborn: a Python data visualization, widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling, and exploratory data analysis tasks.

scikit-learn: also known as sklearn, provides an efficient framework for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

scipy: a library for scientific computing in Python, provided a collection of mathematical algorithms and functionality such as optimization, interpolation, integration, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics

sqldf: a Python library that provides a SQL-like interface for querying pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax.

# Datasets:
The project will utilize historical data for economic indicators and the stock performance of relevant tech companies.

Daily historical interest rates data from Treasury Department:
https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2023

Stock market index: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history?p=SPY 

NVIDIA: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history?p=NVDA

AMD: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/history?p=AMD 

Intel: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/history?p=INTC 

# Methods:
The method involves the application of machine learning algorithms, including regression models and time series forecasting techniques to predict NVIDIA stock prices. Below are the key steps.

Data Collection: Collect historical stock prices data for NVDA, INTC, AMD, and SPY, spanning the past five years. Also obtain macroeconomic data from the Treasury Department.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Create lagged variables and relevant features to capture potential dependencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to visualize the data, identify correlations, and gain insights into potential relationships between macroeconomic factors, semiconductor stocks, and NVIDIA.

Model Selection: Split data into training and testing subsets. Utilize regression models and time series forecasting techniques to predict stock prices.

Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions for Toyota stock performance for a specific future period.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2).

# Ethical Considerations:

Ethical considerations will be maintained throughout the project, focusing on data privacy, security, and fairness. Any potential biases in the data or models will be addressed to ensure transparency and equity. Avoiding market manipulation and adhering to regulatory compliance

# Challenges/Issues:

Challenges may include data quality issues, model accuracy, and the dynamic nature of financial markets. Handling missing data, outliers, and addressing potential economic shifts are among the challenges anticipated during the project.
