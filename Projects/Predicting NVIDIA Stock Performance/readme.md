# Predicting NVIDIA stock performance based on key financial and technology indicators.
This project embarks on a journey to predict NVIDIA stock performance using cutting-edge machine learning techniques and by leveraging essential economic indicators. I will alos consider the performance of key players in the tech industry, such as Intel and AMD, to gain a holistic view of the market dynamics. By analyzing historical data and identifying correlations between these variables, the goal is to provide valuable insights to investors, financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders.

# Required Libraries:
matplotlib: data visualization library for Python, widely used in data analysis, scientific research, engineering, and visualization tasks.

numpy: numerical computations and data manipulation in Python.

pandas: data manipulation, preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

seaborn: a Python data visualization, widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling, and exploratory data analysis tasks.

scikit-learn: also known as sklearn, provides an efficient framework for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

scipy: a library for scientific computing in Python, provided a collection of mathematical algorithms and functionality such as optimization, interpolation, integration, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics

sqldf: a Python library that provides a SQL-like interface for querying pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax.

# Datasets:
The project will utilize historical data for economic indicators and the stock performance of relevant tech companies.
