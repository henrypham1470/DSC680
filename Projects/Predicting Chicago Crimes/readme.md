# Predicting Chicago Crimes Using Time Series.

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and proactive predictive model for forecasting crime incidents in the city of Chicago using advanced time series analysis techniques. Accurate predictions of crime occurrences in Chicago are essential for law enforcement agencies, city planners, and policymakers aiming to enhance public safety and allocate resources effectively. By harnessing the power of time series analysis and historical crime data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can assist in crime prevention and response strategies.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the profound value that accurate crime predictions can offer to law enforcement agencies and the community. By adopting a data-driven approach, rigorous methodology, and ethical data usage practices, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower stakeholders to make informed decisions related to crime prevention and response.

# Required Libraries:

matplotlib: data visualization library for Python, widely used in data analysis, scientific research, engineering, and visualization tasks.

numpy: numerical computations and data manipulation in Python.

pandas: data manipulation, preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

seaborn: a Python data visualization, widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling, and exploratory data analysis tasks.

scikit-learn: also known as sklearn, provides an efficient framework for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

scipy: a library for scientific computing in Python, provided a collection of mathematical algorithms and functionality such as optimization, interpolation, integration, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics

sqldf: a Python library that provides a SQL-like interface for querying pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax.

# Dataset:

ChicagoCrimes: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/currie32/crimes-in-chicago 

# Methods:

The analysis will involve using the Prophet model, a time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook. The Prophet model will be trained on historical crime data to make predictions for future crime rates in Chicago. The model will take into account seasonality, trends, and other factors that may influence crime patterns.

# Ethical Considerations:

Some potential ethical concerns related to this topic include ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the data being used, as well as considering the potential biases in the data that may impact the accuracy of the predictions. It is important to handle the data responsibly and ethically to avoid any misuse or discrimination in law enforcement practices.

# Challenges/Issues:

Some challenges that may be faced during the project include dealing with the complexity and variability of crime data, handling outliers and anomalies in the dataset, and addressing potential biases in the data that may affect the forecasting accuracy. Additionally, interpreting the results and ensuring that the predictions are used responsibly by law enforcement agencies may also pose challenges.
