# Predicting Bank Customer Churn.

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and actionable predictive model for forecasting bank customer churn, assisting financial institutions in retaining customers and enhancing customer satisfaction. Accurate predictions of customer churn are pivotal for banks and financial institutions seeking to proactively address attrition, improve customer engagement, and optimize retention strategies. By harnessing the power of predictive analytics and historical customer data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can bolster customer relationship management in the banking sector.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the substantial value that accurate churn predictions can offer to banks and financial institutions. By adopting a data-driven approach, rigorous methodology, and ethical data usage practices, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower financial institutions to proactively address customer churn and enhance customer relationship management.
