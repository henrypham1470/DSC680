# Predicting Bank Customer Churn.

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and actionable predictive model for forecasting bank customer churn, assisting financial institutions in retaining customers and enhancing customer satisfaction. Accurate predictions of customer churn are pivotal for banks and financial institutions seeking to proactively address attrition, improve customer engagement, and optimize retention strategies. By harnessing the power of predictive analytics and historical customer data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can bolster customer relationship management in the banking sector.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the substantial value that accurate churn predictions can offer to banks and financial institutions. By adopting a data-driven approach, rigorous methodology, and ethical data usage practices, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower financial institutions to proactively address customer churn and enhance customer relationship management.

# Required Libraries:

matplotlib: data visualization library for Python, widely used in data analysis, scientific research, engineering, and visualization tasks.

numpy: numerical computations and data manipulation in Python.

pandas: data manipulation, preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

seaborn: a Python data visualization, widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling, and exploratory data analysis tasks.

scikit-learn: also known as sklearn, provides an efficient framework for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

scipy: a library for scientific computing in Python, provided a collection of mathematical algorithms and functionality such as optimization, interpolation, integration, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics

sqldf: a Python library that provides a SQL-like interface for querying pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax.

# Dataset:

Customer Churn: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakash50897/churn-modellingcsv

# Methods:

The analysis will involve using classification models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on the input features. Regression models can also be used to predict the likelihood of churn or the probability of a customer leaving the bank.

# Ethical Considerations:

Some potential ethical concerns related to this topic include ensuring the privacy and security of customer data, avoiding bias in the predictive models that may lead to discriminatory practices, and being transparent about how customer data is being used for churn prediction. It is important to handle customer data responsibly and ethically to maintain trust and confidentiality.

# Challenges/Issues:

Some challenges that may be faced during the project include dealing with imbalanced datasets where the number of churned customers is significantly lower than non-churned customers, handling missing or noisy data in the dataset, and interpreting the model results in a way that is actionable for the bank to take preventive measures against churn.
