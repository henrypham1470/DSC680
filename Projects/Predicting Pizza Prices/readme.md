# Predicting Pizza Prices.

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model for forecasting pizza prices, benefiting pizzerias, customers, and the food service industry. Accurate price predictions for pizzas enable pizzerias to optimize pricing strategies, offer competitive rates, and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, customers can make informed choices, and the food service industry can gain insights into pricing dynamics. By harnessing data analytics and historical pricing data, this project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can contribute to pricing transparency and informed decision-making in the pizza market.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the value that accurate pizza price predictions can offer to pizzerias and customers. For pizzerias, accurate pricing can optimize revenue and improve customer satisfaction. For customers, it allows for informed choices and budget planning.
