# Predicting Toyota Stock Performance using Machine Learning and Technology Indicators
This project embarks on the task of predicting Toyota stock performance by utilizing machine learning techniques and incorporating economic indicators, as well as the stock performance of Intel, AMD, Goodyear Tire, Honda, and the S&P 500 index. By analyzing historical data and establishing correlations between these variables, I seek to provide valuable insights to investors, financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders.

# Methods:
The method involves the application of machine learning algorithms, including regression models and time series forecasting techniques to predict Toyota stock prices. Below are the key steps.

Data Collection: Gather historical stock prices data for TM, INTC, AMD, GT, SPY, and HMC, spanning the past five years. Also obtain macroeconomic data from the Treasury Department.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Create lagged variables and relevant features to capture potential dependencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to visualize the data, identify correlations, and gain insights into potential relationships between macroeconomic factors, semiconductor stocks, Tire manufacturer, and Toyota.

Model Selection: Split data into training and testing subsets. Utilize regression models and time series forecasting techniques to predict stock prices.

Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions for Toyota stock performance for a specific future period.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2).

# Ethical Considerations:

Ethical considerations will be maintained throughout the project, focusing on data privacy, security, and fairness. Any potential biases in the data or models will be addressed to ensure transparency and equity. Avoiding market manipulation and adhering to regulatory compliance

# Challenges/Issues:

Challenges may include data quality issues, model accuracy, and the dynamic nature of financial markets. Handling missing data, outliers, and addressing potential economic shifts are among the challenges anticipated during the project.
