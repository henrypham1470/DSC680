# Predicting Toyota Stock Performance using Machine Learning and Technology Indicators
This project embarks on the task of predicting Toyota stock performance by utilizing machine learning techniques and incorporating economic indicators, as well as the stock performance of Intel, AMD, Goodyear Tire, Honda, and the S&P 500 index. By analyzing historical data and establishing correlations between these variables, I seek to provide valuable insights to investors, financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders.
