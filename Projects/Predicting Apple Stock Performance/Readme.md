# Predicting Apple Stock Performance based on Macroeconomic and Technology Indicators.

In this project, I am going to forecast AAPL stock performance by embracing a holistic approach that factors in diverse variables. The focus extends beyond traditional fundamental analysis to encompass a range of critical indicators that have the potential to influence AAPL's market valuation.

At the heart of the predictive model lie several key elements: interest rates, the S&P 500 stock market index, and the stock prices of major semiconductor companiesâ€”AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. These elements form a multifaceted framework that captures the essence of AAPL's performance in the context of broader market trends and technological advancements.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the immense value that accurate stock price predictions can offer to investors and financial analysts. By leveraging data-driven analysis, advanced modeling techniques, and an ethical approach to data usage, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower stakeholders to make well-informed investment decisions related to AAPL.
