# Predicting the US Retail Sales Using Time Series

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and actionable predictive model for forecasting retail sales in the United States using advanced time series analysis techniques. Accurate predictions of U.S. retail sales are essential for retailers, economists, and policymakers who rely on this critical economic indicator to make informed decisions and navigate the dynamic landscape of the retail sector. By harnessing the power of time series analysis and historical retail sales data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can enhance strategic planning and decision-making.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the significant value that accurate retail sales predictions can provide to retailers, economists, and policymakers. By adopting a data-driven approach, rigorous methodology, and ethical data usage practices, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower stakeholders to make well-informed decisions related to U.S. retail sales.

# Required Libraries:

matplotlib: data visualization library for Python, widely used in data analysis, scientific research, engineering, and visualization tasks.

numpy: numerical computations and data manipulation in Python.

pandas: data manipulation, preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

seaborn: a Python data visualization, widely used in data analysis, statistical modeling, and exploratory data analysis tasks.

scikit-learn: also known as sklearn, provides an efficient framework for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

scipy: a library for scientific computing in Python, provided a collection of mathematical algorithms and functionality such as optimization, interpolation, integration, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics

sqldf: a Python library that provides a SQL-like interface for querying pandas DataFrames using SQL syntax.

# Dataset:

Retail Sales: https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=RETAIL_SALES&apikey=demo 

# Methods:

The analysis will involve using the Prophet model, a time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook. The Prophet model is particularly suited for forecasting retail sales data as it can handle seasonality, holiday effects, and outliers effectively. The model will be trained on historical data and used to make predictions for future retail sales.

Data Collection: Gather historical stock prices data for US retail sales.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to visualize the data, identify correlations, and gain insights into potential relationships between variables.

Model Selection: Prophet model.

Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions for US retail sales for a specific future period.

# Ethical Considerations:

Some potential ethical concerns related to this topic include ensuring the privacy and security of the data being used, as well as being transparent about the methods and assumptions made in the forecasting process. It is important to handle the data responsibly and ethically to avoid any misuse or bias in the results.

# Challenges/Issues:

Some challenges that may be faced during the project include dealing with missing or incomplete data, handling outliers and seasonality in the retail sales data, and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model. Additionally, interpreting and communicating the results effectively to stakeholders may also pose a challenge.
