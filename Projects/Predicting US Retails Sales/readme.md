# Predicting the US Retail Sales Using Time Series

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and actionable predictive model for forecasting retail sales in the United States using advanced time series analysis techniques. Accurate predictions of U.S. retail sales are essential for retailers, economists, and policymakers who rely on this critical economic indicator to make informed decisions and navigate the dynamic landscape of the retail sector. By harnessing the power of time series analysis and historical retail sales data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can enhance strategic planning and decision-making.

The driving force behind this project is the recognition of the significant value that accurate retail sales predictions can provide to retailers, economists, and policymakers. By adopting a data-driven approach, rigorous methodology, and ethical data usage practices, I aim to provide actionable insights that empower stakeholders to make well-informed decisions related to U.S. retail sales.
